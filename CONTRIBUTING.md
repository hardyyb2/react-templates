## What should I know before I get started?

- The frontend templates haven been bootstrapped with [creat-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/)
- The project currently consists of the following major technologies (click and know more about them):
  - [React](https://youtu.be/1wZoGFF_oi4)
  - [Redux](https://blog.logrocket.com/why-use-redux-reasons-with-clear-examples-d21bffd5835/)
  - [Firebase](https://medium.com/firebase-developers/what-is-firebase-the-complete-story-abridged-bcc730c5f2c0)
  - [Node.js](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-exactly-is-node-js-ae36e97449f5/)
  - [MongoDB](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-mongodb-working-and-features/)
- Knowledge of [version control](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control) and [Git and Github](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9goXbgTDQ0n_4TBzOO0ocPR)
- Knowledge of [clean code](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript) would be required while contributing and would also be beneficial for your app's scalability and readability.

## What does this project _do_ and Why is it _useful_

- This project consists of various templates which can be used to speed up the initial phase of setup and development
- Separate projects involve various technologies which take up a tremendous amount of time and effort to setup, before they can even be used (e.g. redux)
- With template already setup users can focus entirely on building their own application.
- For projects involving firebase, authentication (Google for now) has already been taken care of.
- For projects involving Node and MongoDB, database connection along with server file have been setup.
- A good directory and file structure (open to change) and naming conventions along with example files have been used to promote better design patterns, clean code and suitable heirarchy.

## How do I get started

Steps to start with the templates have been mentioned in each project's individual README.
Although the procedure is common, as mentioned below :

- Click on the template name you want to use. You will be redirected to the template github repo.
- Checkout to `main` branch and click on Code button, select your preffered method (https, ssh or github cli) and click on copy icon button
- Open your favored terminal (or integrated terminal in VS Code) and type `git clone [repo-link]`, replace _[repo-link]_ with the copied url and press Enter
- The template should be cloned to your local machine
- Now from root, enter `yarn install-all` or `npm install-all`
- Wait for some time while the dependencies download and link, and then enter :

  - `yarn start` or `npm start` to run in development mode (hot reload only in client)
  - `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` to run in developement mode (hot reload in both client and server)
