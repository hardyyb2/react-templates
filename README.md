## MOTIVATION

- Often times while starting a new project, the initial setup phase takes a huge amount of time and effort, especially when using technologies like _Redux_, or _Firebase(with auth)_ etc.
- This common boilerplate used in every project needs to be re-written with every new project, and thus induces frustation and even more wastage of time
- Using these prebuilt templates, this phase of setup is substantially reduced, if not completely eliminated
